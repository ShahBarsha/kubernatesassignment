● Make sure you’re connecting to the service’s cluster IP from within the cluster, not from the
outside.

● Don’t bother pinging the service IP to figure out if the service is accessible (remember, the
service’s cluster IP is a virtual IP and pinging it will never work).

● If you’ve defined a readiness probe, make sure it’s succeeding; otherwise the pod won’t be
part of the service.

● To confirm that a pod is part of the service, examine the corresponding Endpoints object with
kubectl get endpoints.

● Check whether you’re connecting to the port exposed by the service and not the target port.

● Try connecting to the pod IP directly to confirm your pod is accepting connections on the
correct port.
