1. Write a common use-case, where you will use a daemon set instead of replica set.

DaemonSets create pods by default on each node in the cluster, unless the node selector constrains them and it is necessary to add the desired set of labels to a subset of nodes initially.

Node selectors are part of the nodeSelector field within the DaemonSet YAML file.

In the below yaml file, a DaemonSet is going to deploy nginx only on nodes labeled as type=developer

Get it using the kubectl label command and Add the type=developer label to the "worker nodes" node with the following command:

Command: kubectl label nodes <worker nodes> type=developer

Filename: DemonSet_new.yml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: developer
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: developer
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: developer
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        type: developer
      containers:
      - name: developer
        image: nginx/Developer


Adding the type=developer label to a new node is going to deploy the developer Pod to that node. If a label is removed from a node, the DaemonSet controller removes the Pod as well.
